Matplotlib's pyplot module provides a wide range of plot types for various data visualization needs. Here's a summary of the main categories and their corresponding plot types:

1. Line and Scatter Plots
plot(): Basic line plot.
scatter(): Scatter plot for individual points.
step(): Step plot for connecting data points with steps.
stem(): Stem plot to display vertical lines at each data point.

2. Bar Plots
bar(): Vertical bar plot.
barh(): Horizontal bar plot.

3. Histograms
hist(): Displays the distribution of data as a histogram.
hist2d(): 2D histogram for two-dimensional data.

4. Pie Charts
pie(): Creates a pie chart.

5. Statistical Plots
boxplot(): Box-and-whisker plot for statistical data visualization.
violinplot(): Violin plot, a combination of box plot and KDE.
errorbar(): Line plot with error bars.

6. Density Plots
hexbin(): Hexagonal binning plot for two-dimensional data density.
contour(): Contour plot for visualizing three-dimensional data in two dimensions.
contourf(): Filled contour plot.

7. Images and Heatmaps
imshow(): Displays image data.
matshow(): Matrix visualization.
pcolor(): Pseudocolor plot for matrix data.
pcolormesh(): Faster pseudocolor plot.
spy(): Visualizes the sparsity of a matrix.

8. Polar Plots
polar(): Polar plot for data in polar coordinates.

9. 3D Plots (Using mpl_toolkits.mplot3d)
plot_surface(): Surface plot.
scatter3D(): 3D scatter plot.
plot_wireframe(): Wireframe plot.
contour3D(): 3D contour plot.

10. Time Series and Date Plots
plot_date(): Plotting time-series data with dates.
fill_between(): Fills the area between two curves.

11. Specialized Plots
quiver(): Vector field plot.
streamplot(): Streamline plot for vector fields.
eventplot(): Event plot to visualize events along a timeline.

12. Customizations
While not specific "plots," pyplot offers extensive functions for customizing plots:

title(): Add a title.
xlabel() / ylabel(): Label axes.
legend(): Add a legend.
grid(): Add grid lines.
xlim() / ylim(): Set axis limits.

How Many in Total?
If you include all the main plot types and their variations, pyplot offers 30+ plot types. This doesn't even count the additional functionality provided through external toolkits like seaborn (for statistical plots) or mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (for 3D plots).
